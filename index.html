  <br>Not really sure how to start this, I'll probably use this to put down a funny memory or thought of the day.</p>
  <br>Today, my husband and I decided that the easter bunny came early. My babies slept downstairs in the Morgan home, so they woke to their baskets on our stairs. My daughter was everywhere! "Ooo, theres one here. One over there!" so jumpy and overwhelmed. Meanwhile my son was his normal chill self, he picked up more than 5 eggs and was done.</p>
  <br>After dealing with a couple of hyper mini-me's, my in-laws stopped by for an early easter suppper. Menu of roast beef, ham, stuffing, brussel sprouts with bacon, and some baked mini potatoes (I forget the name) and honey glazed carrots. Obviously with some mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce.</p>
  <br>Winding down now, daughter decided to run away for the night. With this social distancing, it's getting to her, she's definately missing her cousins, Biips (uncle), aunties and other Jijiis (grandma). Time to get my little boss man down for the night, thank you for reading this far if ya made it. T'ooyaksiniin. I think I spelled that right hah. Means thank you.</p>

  <br>As I typed the date, I spoke "wed nes day" just me? ok, haha. Today was day 3 of GIS/GPS Mapping in the program, I'm enjoying it, but I don't think it's for me.</p>
  <br>As I listen to dashboard confessional, I did the inquiry form for the Network tech furtures program. I'm a little hesitant, scared I won't be able to finish the program and end up dissapointing the ones close to me. At the moment, I'm in the Innovation and technology program, which is kind of like an intro to specific fields.</p>
  <br>My parents are taking care and watching my kids(monsters) during the day, 830-4. I don't know if I should ask them to keep looking after them during the day if I get into the futures program. Having the futures course being put online is such a blessing, also with having financial support is crazy amazing.</p>
  <br> I'm torn. I don't know.</p>
