  <p>What going on with me so far is not much, I have graduated highschool, but have not attended post-secondary. I am currently in the Foundations in Innovation and Technology Certificate program, it was nerve wracking at first just because it's been a long time before I did any schooling, but i'm very happy and appreciative to have this offered in my community.</p>
