  <p> What I can tell you right now is that, I'm 26, turning 27 in October. I come from and live in New Aiyansh BC, born in Terrace BC. I come from the house of Ksdiyaawak, my tribe is Laxgibuu (wolf).</p>

  <p>I am married, got married in August 2019. My husband is Micheal Morgan, we have 2 kids together, Lyla and Taylor. My husband and I have been together for 9 years now, 10s years in May.</p>

  <p>What's going on with me so far is not much, I have graduated highschool, but have not attended post-secondary. I am currently in the Foundations in Innovation and Technology Certificate program, it was nerve wracking at first just because it's been a long time before I did any schooling, but i'm very happy and appreciative to have this offered in my community.</p>

  <br>I like reading, I read alot in highschool but haven't had time these past few years. Stayed home with my babies. I can be a real TV bug too, I love the Marvel Universe, Star Wars, Harry Potter, Lord of The Rings, with a mix of the classics. Anime is also on the top of the list, mostly Naruto and Naruto Shippuden. I think I could really just go on and on about it, but the list is a little long. My guilty pleasure is probably the Twilight Saga, ugh! I know. Sorry. OH! I so do love the Hayao Miyazak films, perfection. One of my favourites have to be Ponyo, and Totoro. OOoo! There's also Spirited Away. Like I put, the list goes on, now I don't think I have a fave. Ugh!</p>

  <br>My taste in music is all over the place, from todays top 40 to pop, rock, indie, alternative, normally depends on my mood. Not much more I can put down, I'll probably update when I do.</p>
